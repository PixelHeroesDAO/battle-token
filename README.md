# battle-token
Battle Tokens are ERC20 tokens that are bridged from the Battle Heroes' exp.
To bridge from an off-chain database, they must be minted with a signature by the bridge system's private key.
This token will also be designed to be bridgeable beyond the minted chain by complying with LayerZero's OFT.
